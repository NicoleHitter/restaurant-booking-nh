## Testing 


### Validation
I have used the pycodestyle library to help me find and solve the errors in my code.

## Deployment

### Heroku
The project is deployed on Heroku. The steps are as follow:

1. In your project: Create `requirements.txt` file with
 `pip3 freeze` > `requirements.txt`
2. Create Heroku account.
3. Create new project. 
4. Pick Github and find the repo with the project you want to deploy.
5. Go to Setting and press Reveal Config Vars.
4. You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`
5. Underneath add the following buildpacks:
      1. `heroku/python`
      2. `heroku/nodejs`
5. Go to Deploy button, pick which branch you want to deploy - was main in my case.
6. Click deploy and wait until the project is build, watch out for any errors.


### Gitpod
After opening the repository in GitHub, you can press on Gitpod button which will take you to Gitpod. 
In Gitpod first termcolor needs to be installed by typing `python3 -m pip install termcolor`, then app is run by pressing `python3 run.py` command on terminal.
