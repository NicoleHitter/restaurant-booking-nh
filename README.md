# Restaurant Booking NH
## Introduction
This website is designed for a fictional bakery restaurant. Through Restaurant Booking NH users can create an account, log in, make reservations and then manage them for the bakery restaurant. 

This website has been created as the Fourth Milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Diploma and was built using Full Stack Toolkit. The project is using Django, Python, HTML and CSS as the main technologies.

# UX
## User Stories 
This project was developed with agile planning. This means that each feature was split first into User Stories for what the user of the website would expect. GitHub issues were used to record all the user stories. As the project progressed each story was then moved from 'To Do' to 'In Progress' to 'Done'.

![User Stories](static/doc/screenshots/UserStories.jpeg)

* As a customer you will:
  * Be able to create an account.
  * Be able to select the time and date of reservation.
  * Be able to select the group size and leave a comment in case they have any special requirements.
  * Be able to edit their reservation or delete it.

* As a site administrator you will:
  * Be able to check the number of custumers.
  * Be able to see details of the customers.


## Development Planes
### Strategy
#### Targeted Users
* A user that wants to reserve a table in the bakery restaurant, who could be an old or a new user of any age group that prefers to use an online booking system. 

#### Site Goals
* For users to be able to create an account.
* For users to be able to reserve a table.
* For users to be able to edit or delete their reservation online.

#### Project Goals 
* Create a booking website for a bakery that will help facilitate their services and reduce the human workload by having an easy-to-use booking system which they can access easily. This will bring them a quick way of checking the number of custumers and also they will be able to keep their customer's information. 
* Learn how to create a booking system which has full CRUD functionality.

### Scope 
The Scope Plane was about developing website requirements based on the goals set out in the strategy plane.
* Home page welcome message which immediately tells the user what the site is for.
* Account registration which will allow for restricted viewing on Editing and Deleting pages and booking a reservation.
* Fully responsive website, tested across all screen sizes, with navigation for mobile.
* Ability to create, view, update and delete appointments.

### Structure
The information above has been used then to create the structure of the site. The diagram has been generated by following these steps created with the Lucidchard app.

### Wireframes 
Before building, and planning this website I used the design tool Balsamiq, to create a wireframe for the project. It allowed me to make a basic sketch of what I wanted the website to look like, what features to include and where to place them. This proved to be very useful as I could base my decisions on the already sketched-out wireframe when building the website.

### Surface
#### Style and colours
The style I was aiming for in the end would be an elegant and warm impression and I wanted it to be a theme throughout the entire website. 

Colours have been specified in CSS by hexadecimal (or hex) values. The colours used are complementary.

The navigation bar is cold green and the content is mostly pink. The footer is Lila which fits well with the rest of the colours.

Green is meant to make the user think about fresh products and nature, then pink and gold to introduce him to the world of fairytales as if to say that despite being made with natural ingredients the products also look very good.

The font style used is Castoro Titling from Google Fonts. 

# Features
## Existing Features
  1. Home Page 
  ![Home Page](/static/doc/screenshots/homepage.jpeg)
   On the landing page, the user is welcomed and assured about what the site is about through a main message. Also, the navbar and footer are present from where he can explore further.

  2. Navigation
  ![Navigation Bar](/static/doc/screenshots/navbar.jpeg)
  At the top of every view, the user is presented with a navbar. The navbar contains the restaurant's logo, which by clicking, allows the user to return to the front page at any time. Also to the right, the navbar consists of links to a Book A Table page, a Register page, a Login page and for authorised users a Reservations, as well as a Home button that brings the user back to the landing page. 
  On smaller screens, all the above features collapse under a hamburger menu, except for the logo which always stays on the left of the navigation bar.

  3.  Book a Table 
  ![Book a Table](/static/doc/screenshots/reservationform.jpeg)
  Next up is the Book A Table page. Which has all the previously mentioned header and footer features and a reservation form.
  Once a user has either logged into their account or created an account they will be able to view the reservation form
  On the reservation form, after filling in their details, the user has the option to pick the date, time and group size for the reservation.
  The user also has the option to leave a comment through which the user can let the restaurant know of any special requirements.

  4. Register
  ![Register](/static/doc/screenshots/registerform.jpeg)
  On the register page user will have to fill in their details, register and then log in, to be able to make a reservation.  
 
  5. Reservations
  ![Reservations](/static/doc/screenshots/myreservations.jpeg)
  Once logged in user can go into the Reservations area from where he can see, edit or cancel his reservations. 

  6. Footer 
  ![Footer](/static/doc/screenshots/footer.jpeg)
  The footer section is present on all pages and it includes links to all social media pages. It is useful for the user as it encourages them to keep connected through social media and it also helps the bakery, as it increases publicity.
  

## Features Left to Implement
  * Automated confirmation emails - emails to be sent out to a user when they have made, edited or cancelled a booking
  * Avoid overbookings - a backend feature that filters through all the bookings at a certain time and makes sure that the number of bookings does not exceed the number of available seats

## Validation
* HTML: - No errors were found when passed through the [W3C Validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

* CSS: - No errors were found when passed through the [W3C Validator tool](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) tool

* JavaScript: - No costume Javascript was used in this project. The Javascript included at the end of my base.html was taken from the Code Institutes walkthrough project.

* No errors were returned when passing through [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).


## Fixed Bugs 
* I was unable to migrate because of an error: column "email" not found. I struggled to understand this at first as wouldn't get from where was coming. I spent about two hours with my mentor that has guided me and helped me understand that I would have to erase this email col from the database and then add it again, changes to the migration files had to be done subsequently. We still did not find the reason for this error but we have managed to resolve it. 
* When using screens smaller than 400px there would be an extra white space on the right side of the page which was coming from a margin of the col-md-5 that has previously been set in "%". Once that measurement changed to px space disappeared. 
* Previously users would be able to make more bookings on the same day and at the same time, which has been changed by adding constraints to the data model. 


# Deployment
The following are the steps I went through to deploy my live site:

* The site was deployed using Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
1. Go to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
2. Go to 'New' and select 'Create a new app'
3. Input your app name and create app.
4. Navigate to 'Settings'
5. On the Config Vars section, enter the following values:
    * SECRET_KEY: The Secret Key for your project
    * DATABASE_URL: The URL from your ElephantSQL dashboard
    * CLOUNDINARY_URL: The URL from your Cloudinary dashboard
    * PORT: 8000
6. Navigate to the 'Deploy' section. 
7. Connect to GitHub, search for your repo and confirm. 
8. Choose branch to deploy.
9. Your app should now be available to see. You can choose whether to have your app automatically redeploy with every push or to keep it manual. 

* To Fork the repository:
  * On GitHub.com, navigate to the repository.
  * In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
  * Select an owner for the forked repository.
  * By default, forks are named the same as their parent repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further.
  * Optionally, add a description of your fork.
  * Choose whether to copy only the default branch or all branches to the new fork.
  * Click Create fork.

* To Clone the repository:
  * On GitHub.com, navigate to the repository.
  * Above the list of files, click the Code button.
  * Copy the URL for the repository.
  * Open Git Bash.
  * Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
  * Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
  * Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
